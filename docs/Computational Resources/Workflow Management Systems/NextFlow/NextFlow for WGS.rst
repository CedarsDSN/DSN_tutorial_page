**NextFlow for WGS**
====================

NextFlow has been set up for Cedars-Sinai in the compbio cluster (esplhpccompbio-lv01.csmc.edu). If you have access to this cluster, you can directly load NextFlow using this command

.. code-block:: RST

  module load nextflow
  module load java/jdk-11.0.12

Along with the above, it is recommended to provide directories for singularity container execution and temporary storage. 

.. code-block:: RST

  export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/common/group_folder/data/project_folder
  export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/common/group_folder/data/project_folder/singularity_cache

  export TMPDIR=/common/group_folder/projects/temp/project_folder

The next thing you would need is to create a samplesheet.csv file with information about the samples you are using for WGS analysis. The format should be comma-separated columns and should contain the patient ID, sample name, the lane, and the path of the paired fastq files. Each row represents a pair of fastq files.
