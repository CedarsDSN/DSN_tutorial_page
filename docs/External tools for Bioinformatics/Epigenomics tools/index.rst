**Epigenomics tools**
=====================

Below are various tools used for Epigenomics sequencing data analysis

MACS (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq): A well-established tool for peak calling in ChIP-Seq data, helping researchers identify regions of protein-DNA binding such as histone modifications.

SICER (Spatial Clustering for Identification of ChIP-Enriched Regions): This tool is designed for ChIP-Seq data to identify broader regions of enrichment, especially useful for studying histone modifications.
