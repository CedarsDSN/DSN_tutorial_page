**GWAS and Population analysis tools**
======================================

Below are tools that are used to conduct GWAS and population analysis-

**Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Tools**

`PLINK <https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/tutorial.shtml>`_: Handles association testing and linkage analysis in population genomics.

`SNPTEST <https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/~gav/snptest/>`_: For genotype and phenotype association testing, particularly suited for large cohorts.

`GCTA <https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Overview>`_: Genome-wide complex trait analysis tool for mixed linear models, primarily in GWAS.

`BOLT-LMM <https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/BOLT-LMM/BOLT-LMM_manual.html>`_: For GWAS, specifically designed for large datasets, using linear mixed models.

`GEMMA <https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/blob/master/doc/manual.pdf>`_: GEMMA (Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association) is a popular tool for performing GWAS and is specifically designed to handle large datasets with mixed linear models (MLM)

**Population Genomics Analysis**

`VCFtools <https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html>`_: Useful for handling VCF files, including filtering, merging, and basic summary statistics.

`Admixture <https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/admixture-manual.pdf>`_: For inferring population structure and admixture patterns.

`Haploview <https://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/tutorial>`_: Visualization tool for haplotype patterns and LD analysis in population studies.
