**Proteomics**
==============

Under this section are all cutting-edge proteomics analysis tools.

`MaxQuant <https://www.maxquant.org/>`_: A powerful software for analyzing large-scale proteomics data, especially from mass spectrometry, with a focus on label-free quantification.

`MSFragger <https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/>`_: A fast, open-source peptide identification tool for large-scale proteomics studies, particularly effective in high-resolution mass spectrometry data analysis.

`Scaffold <https://www.proteomesoftware.com/products/scaffold-5>`_: A proteomics data visualization and analysis platform that integrates multiple experiment datasets and offers comprehensive peptide and protein-level quantitation.

`OpenMS <https://openms.de/>`_: An open-source software framework that enables developers and researchers to analyze LC-MS and MS/MS data in proteomics, with workflows for both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

`Spectronaut <https://biognosys.com/resources/spectronaut-a-groundbreaking-increase-in-identifications/>`_: A paid software for data-independent acquisition (DIA) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis, known for its advanced algorithms in proteomics quantification.

`FragPipe <https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/>`_: A pipeline for quantitative proteomics that integrates MSFragger, Philosopher, and IonQuant, optimized for high-performance protein quantification.
