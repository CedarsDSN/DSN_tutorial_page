**Single-cell RNA-seq analysis tools**

`Seurat <https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html>`_: An R package for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, widely used for cell clustering, dimensional reduction, and integration of multiple datasets.
`ScanPy <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_: A Python-based toolkit for large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.
`CellRanger <https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest>`_: Developed by 10x Genomics, it processes single-cell RNA-seq data by demultiplexing, aligning, and clustering cells.
`Monocle <https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/>`_: For trajectory analysis, discovering gene expression changes over pseudo-time in single-cell RNA-seq data.
`SingleCellExperiment <https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html>`_: R package for single-cell data representation and analysis.
`SCENIC <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC/blob/master/inst/doc/SCENIC_Setup.html>`_: For inferring gene regulatory networks in single cells.
`MAESTRO <https://baigal628.github.io/MAESTRO_documentation/>`_: Integrates single-cell multi-omics data (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) to derive cell types and lineage relationships.
