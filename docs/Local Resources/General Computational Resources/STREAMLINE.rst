**STREAMLINE**
==============

STREAMLINE is an end-to-end automated machine learning pipeline that was developed by Ryan Urbanowitz and the lab along with collaborators. It empowers anyone to easily train, interpret, and apply various predictive models as part of a rigorous and optionally customizable data mining analysis. It is programmed in Python 3 using many common libraries, including Pandas and scikit-learn. The readme file and the code is available `here <https://github.com/UrbsLab/STREAMLINE?tab=readme-ov-file>`_
