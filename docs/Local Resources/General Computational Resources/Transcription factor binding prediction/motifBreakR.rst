**motifBreakR**
===============

motifBreakR may be used to interrogate SNPs or SNVs for their potential effect on transcription factor binding by examining how the two alleles of the variant effect the binding score of a motif. The instructions for installation and more are available `here <https://github.com/Simon-Coetzee/motifBreakR>`_ and the vignette is `here <https://simon-coetzee.github.io/motifBreakR/>`_
