**BIRCH**
=========

BIRCH (Batch-effect Identification, Representation and Correction on Heterogeneous data) is a web-app that can be used for reducing batch-effect in proteomics data. It generally becomes necessary to correct for batch-effect in large datasets since processing steps such as sample preparation and data acquisition tends to add noise to the data, that in-turn effects biological conclusions. This tool aims at keeping meaningful biological variation, while simultaneously reducing batch-effect due to other external factors.
