**PINE**
========

PINE has been developed as a fully automated, versatile, and easy to use Cytoscape-based tool30 to facilitate mapping, annotation, and visualization of protein and PTM-level quantitative data generated by either targeted, discovery (DDA and DIA), or other proteomics approaches. It allows users to develop systematic searches for proteins of interest and explore complex network visualizations depicting PPIs and functional relationships. It can be accessed using github `here <https://github.com/csmc-vaneykjlab/pine>`_ and the publication is available `here <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362945/>`_
