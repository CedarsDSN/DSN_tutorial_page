**General Computational Resources**
===================================

Welcome to the collection of the general computational resources provided by researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Under this, we have tools that are web accessible and some other tools that need to be installed using instructions on GitHub. Most of the tools have publications attached to them. You can use the tutorials or the publications to learn more about using them.
