**PAGER**
=========

PAGER is a genotype encoding method specifically designed for improving the detection of deviations from additivity in genotype-phenotype associations and investigating epistasis. It provides a computationally efficient means to capture a variety of inheritance models, including additive, dominant, recessive, and heterotic, without the need for multiple encodings or increased computational cost.
