**AUTOQTL**
===========

AutoQTL is an automated machine learning tool for QTL analysis. The goal of AutoQTL is to automate QTL analysis by building an analytics pipeline optimized for explaining variation in a quantitative trait given a set of genetic variants. It uses genetic programming (GP) as the search and optimization method.

AutoQTL is recommended to be used as a posthoc analysis to genome-wide association/QTL analysis. AutoQTL aims to provide additional insights into the association of phenotype to genotype including, but not limited to, the detection of non-additive genetic inheritance models and epistatic interactions.
