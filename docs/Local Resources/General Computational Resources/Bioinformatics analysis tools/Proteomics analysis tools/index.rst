   * - BIRCH
     - BIRCH (Batch-effect Identification, Representation and Correction on Heterogeneous data) is a web-app that can be used for reducing batch-effect in proteomics data. It generally becomes necessary to correct for batch-effect in large datasets since processing steps such as sample preparation and data acquisition tends to add noise to the data, that in-turn effects biological conclusions. This tool aims at keeping meaningful biological variation, while simultaneously reducing batch-effect due to other external factors.

   * - PINE
     - PINE has been developed as a fully automated, versatile, and easy to use Cytoscape-based tool30 to facilitate mapping, annotation, and visualization of protein and PTM-level quantitative data generated by either targeted, discovery (DDA and DIA), or other proteomics approaches. It allows users to develop systematic searches for proteins of interest and explore complex network visualizations depicting PPIs and functional relationships.
