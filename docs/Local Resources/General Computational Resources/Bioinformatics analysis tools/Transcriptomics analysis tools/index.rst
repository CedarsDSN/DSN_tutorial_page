   * - Platform for Single Cell Science
     - Single-cell omics data analysis pipelines are complicated to design and difficult to share or reproduce. Dr Jesse G Meyer and his team at the Computational Biomedicine describe a web platform that enables no-code analysis pipeline design, simple computing via the Open Science Grid, and sharing of entire data analysis pipelines, their input data, and interactive results.

   * - RNA-seq analysis GENAVi
     - GENAVi is a web-based RNA-seq analysis and visualization platform. This SHINY app was developed by Michelle Jones lab and collaborators. You can bring your own data or use the example data provided by the application. You can conduct differential expression analysis, enrichment analysis and also visulaize your data different ways.
