   * - Treatment Discontinuation Risk
     - The Biostatistics Department has also developed a novel web application to estimate the risk of treatment discontinuation of breast cancer patients undergoing treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen. The application is based on a dynamic risk prediction model where the clinician inputs a patientâ€™s baseline body mass index (BMI), selected PRO symptoms collected over time up to 6 or 12 months, and requests the probability that the patient will stop treatment by a pre-specified time in the future.

   * - Treatment Tolerability
     - This resource has been published by the Biostatistics department of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Visualization tools were developed to explore and visualize clinical trial tolerability data for patients, clinicians, and researchers. Specifically, a novel interactive web application was developed using R and the Shiny web application framework to display numerical and graphical summary statistics of treatment tolerability and QOL over time in cancer patients. The application has four facing tools: Adverse event (AE) explorer, QOL cohort explorer, AE cohort explorer, and AE/QOL explorer.
