     - The IBD&me Decision Tree will ask you questions about different medicine characteristics (see illustration below). As you go through the questions, we will start to learn more about what factors matter most to you. The Decision Tree wonâ€™t recommend a specific medicine to use, but will provide valuable information to help you and your doctor make a more informed choice.
