**Platform for Single Cell Science**
====================================

Single-cell omics data analysis pipelines are complicated to design and difficult to share or reproduce. Dr Jesse G Meyer and his team at the Computational Biomedicine describe a web platform that enables no-code analysis pipeline design, simple computing via the Open Science Grid, and sharing of entire data analysis pipelines, their input data, and interactive results.
