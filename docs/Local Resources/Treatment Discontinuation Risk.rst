**Treatment Discontinuation Risk**
==================================

The Biostatistics Department has also developed a novel web application to estimate the risk of treatment discontinuation of breast cancer patients undergoing treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen. The application is based on a dynamic risk prediction model where the clinician inputs a patientâ€™s baseline body mass index (BMI), selected PRO symptoms collected over time up to 6 or 12 months, and requests the probability that the patient will stop treatment by a pre-specified time in the future. The applications can be found at
