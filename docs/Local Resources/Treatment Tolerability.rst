**Treatment Tolerability**
==========================

This resource has been published by the Biostatistics department of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Visualization tools were developed to explore and visualize clinical trial tolerability data for patients, clinicians, and researchers. Specifically, a novel interactive web application was developed using R and the Shiny web application framework to display numerical and graphical summary statistics of treatment tolerability and QOL over time in cancer patients. The application has four facing tools: Adverse event (AE) explorer, QOL cohort explorer, AE cohort explorer, and AE/QOL explorer. These applications can be accessed at https://cshsbiostats.github.io/breast-cancer-symptom-explorer
