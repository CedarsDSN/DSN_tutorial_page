     - Description
     - Access
   * - All of us
     - The National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program is building one of the largest biomedical data resources of its kind. The All of Us Research Hub stores health data from a diverse group of participants from across the United States. It makes data broadly accessible to researchers of all kinds to support thousands of studies across a wide range of different health topics.

   * - UK Biobank
     -  UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource containing de-identified genetic, lifestyle and health information and biological samples from half a million UK participants. It is the most comprehensive and widely-used dataset of its kind, and is globally accessible to approved researchers who are undertaking health-related research that is in the public interest, whether they are from academic, commercial, government or charitable settings.

   * - TCGA
     -  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions. Over the next dozen years, TCGA generated over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.

   * - CELLxGENE
     -  CZ CELLxGENE Annotate (pronounced "cell-by-gene") is an interactive data explorer for single-cell datasets, such as those coming from the Human Cell Atlas. Leveraging modern web development techniques to enable fast visualizations of at least 1 million cells, we hope to enable biologists and computational researchers to explore their data. Whether you need to visualize one thousand cells or one million, CELLxGENE Annotate helps you gain insight into your single-cell data.

   * - Single Cell Portal
     -  SCP enables data sharing, supports dynamic results visualization, and facilitates scientific exploration across a large repository of single-cell datasets. SCP’s data contributors maintain full control over how their data are shared and presented, without requiring web development expertise. Finally, SCP supports the entire lifecycle of a research project, from sparking an idea, to fine-tuning the data with collaborators, to sharing results in an accessible and interactive way.

   * - Human Cell Atlas Data Portal
     -  The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) community is profiling tens of millions of human cells, a process that generates enormous amounts of data that scientists need to store, standardize and interpret. The HCA Data Portal stores and provides single-cell data contributed by labs around the world. The cloud-based platform houses community generated, multi-omic, open and managed access data. Anyone can use the HCA Data Portal to find and access data, or access community tools and applications used to create the Atlases. The HCA Data Portal includes dedicated webpages for each HCA Biological Network and will include HCA Atlases from each Biological Network as they become available.

   * - Allen Brain Map
     -  The Allen Brain Cell (ABC) Atlas provides a platform for visualizing multimodal single cell data across the mammalian brain and aims to empower researchers to explore and analyze multiple whole-brain datasets simultaneously. This open science resource, developed by the Allen Institute as part of the Brain Knowledge Platform, allows unprecedented insights into the enormous diversity of cell types in the brain and where they are.
