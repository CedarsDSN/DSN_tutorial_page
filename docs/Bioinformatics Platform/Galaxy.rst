If your HPC userid is johndoe, then your userid would be johndoe@csmc.edu). The Galaxy instance set up for Cedars-Sinai is free to use by all Cedars-Sinai employees and is a Bioinformatics resource which is connected to the high-performance cluster. It has workflows which are easy to follow and can be run directly from the Galaxy web interface. We can also help you to develop custom workflows.

The tutorials for Galaxy workflows are `here <https://galaxy-tutorial-landing-page.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
