**Bioinformatics Platforms**
============================

**Introduction**

The provided bioinformatics resources empower researchers and clinicians by offering independent and efficient tools for the analysis and visualization of biomedical data up to a specific proficiency level. These resources can also serve as convenient references for bioinformaticians. Our selection includes popular bioinformatics platforms like Galaxy and Qiagen CLC, along with widely-used visualization tools such as Sequin_RNAseq, GraphBio, and shinyCircos.

**Resources**

* Bioinformatics Platforms

1. Galaxy

Access http://esplgalaxy01.csmc.edu:8080/ and login – userid@csmc.edu (Please note that useid is your HPC user ID and use your HPC password to sign in – for eg. If your HPC userid is johndoe, then your userid would be johndoe@csmc.edu). See “Help” info below if you don’t have a HPC account yet. 
The Galaxy instance set up for Cedars-Sinai is free to use by all Cedars-Sinai employees and is a Bioinformatics resource which is connected to the high-performance cluster. It has workflows which are easy to follow and can be run directly from the Galaxy web interface. We can also help you to develop custom workflows. 

2. Qiagen CLC

CLC is a bioinformatics workbench developed by Qiagen and has many modules and workflows for biologists and bioinformaticians who want to analyze their data. They have a user manual that goes through the workflows and modules in the workbench. Please use this link (https://csmc.service-now.com/cssp/id=cs_home?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a2924104dbad0b00fcdef5361d9619a1) to request for access. We can help you get familiar with this tool.
